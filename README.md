# Node Setup

This Node.js script automates the process of installing dependencies and setting up environment variables for a Node.js project.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file in the project directory. This file will contain the environment variables for your project.

## Usage

To run the Node setup script, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

The script will perform the following tasks:

1. Install project dependencies using the specified package manager (default is npm).
2. Prompt for the name of the environment file (default is `.env`).
3. Prompt for environment variables and their values. You can choose from existing variables or create new ones.
4. Save the environment variables to the specified environment file.

Once the script has finished running, your project will be set up and ready to use.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of the script by modifying the `package.json` file in your project directory. Look for the `node-setup` section, where you can specify the package manager to use and any additional environment variables.
